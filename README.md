## **Introduction**  

Meet Botzo, a quadruped robot designed to:

- Navigate complex terrains 🌄
- Collect data and samples 📊
- Interact with its environment 🌍
  
This project combines sleek design, cutting-edge technology, and practical functionality to redefine robotic mobility—without breaking the bank.

*Why Botzo?*
Inspired by the impressive capabilities of Boston Dynamics’ quadruped robot, we wanted to create an affordable alternative that others could replicate. Botzo aims to:

- Reduce costs significantly compared to existing high-end quadrupeds.
- Democratize robotics by making all hardware and software open source.
- Showcase a practical approach for anyone interested in building their own quadruped robot.

*Open Source Philosophy*
We believe in the power of collaboration and shared knowledge. Everything we develop for Botzo—code, hardware designs, and build instructions—is freely available under an open-source license. This ensures:

- Transparency in design and functionality
- Community-driven improvements and bug fixes
- Easy customization for specialized tasks or research
